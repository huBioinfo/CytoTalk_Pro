## Overview

We have developed the CytoTalk algorithm for *de novo* construction of a
signaling network between two cell types using single-cell
transcriptomics data. This signaling network is the union of multiple
signaling pathways originating at ligand-receptor pairs. Our algorithm
constructs an integrated network of intracellular and intercellular
functional gene interactions. A prize-collecting Steiner tree (PCST)
algorithm is used to extract the signaling network, based on node prize
(cell-specific gene activity) and edge cost (functional interaction
between two genes). The objective of the PCSF problem is to find an
optimal subnetwork in the integrated network that includes genes with
high levels of cell-type-specific expression and close connection to
highly active ligand-receptor pairs.

### Background

Signal transduction is the primary mechanism for cell-cell communication
and scRNA-seq technology holds great promise for studying this
communication at high levels of resolution. Signaling pathways are
highly dynamic and cross-talk among them is prevalent. Due to these two
features, simply examining expression levels of ligand and receptor
genes cannot reliably capture the overall activities of signaling
pathways and the interactions among them.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Please [install
Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)
at the very beginning for all of Windows, Linux and macOS users and make
sure to have [Microsoft Visual C++ Build
Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) and
[Rtools
4.0](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools40.html)
correctly installed for Windows users only.

CytoTalk requires a Python module to operate correctly. To install the
[`pcst_fast` module](https://github.com/fraenkel-lab/pcst_fast), please
run the commands below in the *R* (version 4.1.3) console if you have
`reticulate` installed.

``` r
library(reticulate)  # To install and call Python modules from R.
conda_create(envname = "r_reticulate_CytoTalk", python_version = "3.7.3")  # Create a new Conda environment to facilitate the Python module installation.
conda_install(envname = "r_reticulate_CytoTalk", "pybind11")  # Install two necessary Python modules for correctly compiling and using the "pcst_fast" Python module.
conda_install(envname = "r_reticulate_CytoTalk", "numpy")
conda_install(envname = "r_reticulate_CytoTalk", "git+https://github.com/fraenkel-lab/pcst_fast.git", pip = TRUE) # To install the "pcst_fast" module.
```

CytoTalk outputs a SIF file for use in Cytoscape. Please [install
Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/download.html) to view the whole output
network. Additionally, you’ll have to install Graphviz and add the `dot`
executable to your PATH. See the [Graphviz downloads
page](https://graphviz.org/download/) for more information.

### Installation

If you have `devtools` installed, you can use the `install_github`
function directly on this repository (under development):

``` r
devtools::install_github("tanlabcode/CytoTalk", ref = "feature_RcallPy")
```

### Preparation

Let’s assume we have a folder called “scRNAseq-data”, filled with
single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. Here’s an example directory
structure:

``` txt
── scRNAseq-data
   ├─ scRNAseq_BasalCells.csv
   ├─ scRNAseq_BCells.csv
   ├─ scRNAseq_EndothelialCells.csv
   ├─ scRNAseq_Fibroblasts.csv
   ├─ scRNAseq_LuminalEpithelialCells.csv
   ├─ scRNAseq_Macrophages.csv
   └─ scRNAseq_TCells.csv
```

<br />

⚠ **IMPORTANT** ⚠

Notice all of these files have the prefix “scRNAseq\_” and the extension
“.csv”; CytoTalk looks for files matching this pattern, so be sure to
replicate it with your filenames. Let’s try reading in the folder:

``` r
dir_in <- "~/Tan-Lab/scRNAseq-data"
lst_scrna <- CytoTalk::read_matrix_folder(dir_in)
table(lst_scrna$cell_types)
```

``` console
 BasalCells                 BCells       EndothelialCells 
        392                    743                    251 
Fibroblasts LuminalEpithelialCells            Macrophages 
        700                    459                    186 
     TCells 
       1750
```

The outputted names are all the cell types we can choose to run CytoTalk
against. Alternatively, we can use CellPhoneDB-style input, where one
file is our data matrix, and another file maps cell types to columns
(i.e. metadata):

``` txt
── scRNAseq-data-cpdb
   ├─ sample_counts.txt
   └─ sample_meta.txt
```

There is no specific pattern required for this type of input, as both
filepaths are required for the function:

``` r
fpath_mat <- "~/Tan-Lab/scRNAseq-data-cpdb/sample_counts.txt"
fpath_meta <- "~/Tan-Lab/scRNAseq-data-cpdb/sample_meta.txt"
lst_scrna <- CytoTalk::read_matrix_with_meta(fpath_mat, fpath_meta)
table(lst_scrna$cell_types)
```

``` console
Myeloid NKcells_0 NKcells_1    Tcells 
      1         5         3         1
```

If you have a `SingleCellExperiment` object with `logcounts` and
`colnames` loaded onto it, you can create an input list like so:

``` r
lst_scrna <- CytoTalk::from_single_cell_experiment(sce)
```

Finally, you can compose your own input list quite easily, simply have a
matrix of either count or transformed data and a vector detailing the
cell types of each column:

``` r
mat <- matrix(rpois(90, 5), ncol = 3)
cell_types <- c("TypeA", "TypeB", "TypeA")
lst_scrna <- CytoTalk:::new_named_list(mat, cell_types)
table(lst_scrna$cell_types)
```

``` console
TypeA TypeB 
    2     1
```

### Running CytoTalk

Without further ado, let’s run CytoTalk!

``` r
# read in data folder
dir_in <- "~/Tan-Lab/scRNAseq-data"
lst_scrna <- CytoTalk::read_matrix_folder(dir_in)

# set required parameters
type_a <- "Fibroblasts"
type_b <- "LuminalEpithelialCells"

# run CytoTalk process
results <- CytoTalk::run_cytotalk(lst_scrna, type_a, type_b)
```

``` console
[1 / 8] (11:15:28) Preprocessing...
[2 / 8] (11:16:13) Mutual information matrix...
[3 / 8] (11:20:19) Indirect edge-filtered network...
[4 / 8] (11:20:37) Integrate network...
[5 / 8] (11:21:44) PCSF...
[6 / 8] (11:21:56) Determine best signaling network...
[7 / 8] (11:21:58) Generate network output...
[8 / 8] (11:21:59) Analyze pathways...
```

All we need for a default run is the named list and selected cell types
(“Macrophages” and “LuminalEpithelialCells”). The most important
optional parameters to look at are `cutoff_a`, `cutoff_b`, and
`beta_max`; details on these can be found in the help page for the
`run_cytotalk` function (see `?run_cytotalk`). As the process runs, we
see messages print to the console for each sub process.

Here is what the structure of the output list looks like (abbreviated):

``` r
str(results)
```

``` console
List of 5
 $ params
 $ pem
 $ integrated_net
  ..$ nodes
  ..$ edges
 $ pcst
  ..$ occurances
  ..$ ks_test_pval
  ..$ final_network
 $ pathways
  ..$ raw
  ..$ graphs
  ..$ df_pval
```

In the order of increasing effort, let’s take a look at some of the
results. Let’s begin with the `results$pathways` item. This list item
contains `DiagrammeR` graphs, which are viewable in RStudio, or can be
exported if the `dir_out` parameter is specified during execution. Here
is an example pathway neighborhood:

<div align="center">

<img src="docs/pathway.svg" width="640px" />

</div>

Note that the exported SVG files (see `dir_out` parameter) are
interactive, with hyperlinks to GeneCards and WikiPI. Green edges are
directed from ligand to receptor. Additionally, if we specify an output
directory, we can see a “cytoscape” sub-folder, which includes a SIF
file read to import and two tables that can be attached to the network
and used for styling. Here’s an example of a styled Cytoscape network:

<div align="center">

<img src="docs/cytoscape_network.svg" width="640px" />

</div>

<br />

There are a number of details we can glean from these graphs, such as
node prize (side of each node), edge cost (inverse edge width),
Preferential Expression Measure (intensity of each color), cell type
(based on color, and shape in the Cytoscape output), and interaction
type (dashed lines for crosstalk, solid for intracellular).

If we want to be more formal with the pathway analysis, we can look at
some scores for each neighborhood in the `results$pathways$raw` item.
This list provides extracted subnetworks, based on the final network
from the PCST. Additionally, the `results$pathways$df_pval` item
contains a summary of the neighborhood size for each pathway, along with
theoretical (Gamma distribution) test values that are found by
contrsting the found pathway to random pathways from the integrated
network.
![p](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;p "p")-values
for node prize, edge cost, and potential are calculated separately.

## Update Log

2022-05-05: We have updated the installation and usage of the
[`pcst_fast` module](https://github.com/fraenkel-lab/pcst_fast) for
running the CytoTalk package completely in the *R* console as a new
under-development branch “feature_RcallPy”, which has been tested on
both Windows and macOS.

2021-11-30: The latest release “CytoTalk_v0.99.0” resets the versioning
numbers in anticipation for submission to Bioconductor. This newest
version packages functions in a modular fashion, offering more flexible
input, usage, and output of the CytoTalk subroutines.

2021-10-07: The release “CytoTalk_v4.0.0” is a completely re-written R
version of the program. Approximately half of the run time as been
shaved off, the program is now cross-compatible with Windows and \*NIX
systems, the file space usage is down to roughly a tenth of what it was,
and graphical outputs have been made easier to import or now produce
portable SVG files with embedded hyperlinks.

2021-06-08: The release “CytoTalk_v3.1.0” is a major updated R version
on the basis of v3.0.3. We have added a function to generate Cytoscape
files for visualization of each ligand-receptor-associated pathway
extracted from the predicted signaling network between the two given
cell types. For each predicted ligand-receptor pair, its associated
pathway is defined as the user-specified order of the neighborhood of
the ligand and receptor in the two cell types.

2021-05-31: The release “CytoTalk_v3.0.3” is a revised R version on the
basis of v3.0.2. A bug has been fixed in this version to avoid errors
occurred in some special cases. We also provided a new example
“RunCytoTalk_Example_StepByStep.R” to run the CytoTalk algorithm in a
step-by-step fashion. Please download “CytoTalk_package_v3.0.3.zip” from
the Releases page
(<https://github.com/huBioinfo/CytoTalk/releases/tag/v3.0.3>) and refer
to the user manual inside the package.

2021-05-19: The release “CytoTalk_v3.0.2” is a revised R version on the
basis of v3.0.1. A bug has been fixed in this version to avoid running
errors in some extreme cases. Final prediction results will be the same
as v3.0.1. Please download the package from the Releases page
(<https://github.com/huBioinfo/CytoTalk/releases/tag/v3.0.2>) and refer
to the user manual inside the package.

2021-05-12: The release “CytoTalk_v3.0.1” is an R version, which is more
easily and friendly to use!! Please download the package from the
Releases page
(<https://github.com/huBioinfo/CytoTalk/releases/tag/v3.0.1>) and refer
to the user manual inside the package.
